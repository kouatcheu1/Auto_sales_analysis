# Sales Segmentation was performed using Python; and the following were derived:
- Sales Trends by Product Categories: A bar chart to show the distribution of sales by product lines and a dual-axis chart showing total revenue and average deal sizes by product line.
![](ML_chart_1.png)

- Segment Analysis: A scatter plot showing how quantity ordered relates to price sensitivity for product lines.
![](ML_chart_2.png)
  
- Regional Performance: A treemap to visualize which regions (countries) are driving higher sales performance.

# Forecast Analysis was performed using Python; and the following questions were derived:
- What will be the total sales for the next 1 year?
- *Ans:*
1. Historical Sales (Blue Line):
o	The blue line represents the monthly sales trend over the past periods.
o	You can observe fluctuations in sales, with noticeable peaks and troughs, indicating some seasonality or periodic trends.

2.	Forecasted Sales (Orange Line):
o	The orange line shows the predicted sales for the next 12 months based on the SARIMA model.
o	The forecast continues the trend observed in the historical data, factoring in seasonality, trends, and patterns.

3.	Confidence Interval (Shaded Region):
o	The shaded area around the orange line represents the confidence interval (e.g., 95%).
o	It provides a range within which the actual sales values are likely to fall.
o	A wider confidence interval indicates greater uncertainty in the forecast.

- **Interpretation**:
*The forecast suggests a continuation of the historical trend. If sales were increasing over time, the forecast reflects this growth, and if they were fluctuating seasonally, it accounts for those patterns.*

## Summary

<p align="justify">
  
This analysis focused on sales performance across various dimensions, including product categories, regional trends, customer contributions, and forecast predictions. Key findings include:
1. **Top Performers**: Classic Cars dominate sales, contributing 39.37% of total revenue and leading in quantity ordered with 33,373 units.
2. **Regional Insights**: North America and Europe drive the majority of sales, with dense sales activity observed in cities like Madrid, while regions like Africa underperform.
3. **Customer Contributions**: Top customers, such as Euro Shopping Channel and Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd., significantly contribute to total revenue.
4. **Sales Trends**: November 2018 and November 2019 recorded the highest monthly sales, indicating seasonality.
5. **Order Management**: "Shipped" orders contribute overwhelmingly to revenue, while other order statuses like "Cancelled" and "On Hold" are negligible.
6. **Forecast Analysis**: Using SARIMA, sales for the next 12 months are projected to continue historical trends, with some seasonality and uncertainty reflected in confidence intervals.
7. **Underperforming Categories**: Trains and Ships contribute the least to both revenue and quantity ordered, with sales well below other product lines.

## Conclusion

<p align="justify">
The business demonstrates strong performance in specific areas, with Classic Cars leading both in revenue and sales volume. Regional sales data highlight a concentration in North America and Europe, presenting opportunities for growth in underperforming regions. Key customers play a significant role in revenue generation, showcasing the value of nurturing relationships with high-value clients. Historical data reveal seasonal patterns, providing a basis for targeted sales and inventory strategies. However, underperforming categories like Trains and Ships and regions such as Africa indicate areas requiring strategic interventions.
</p>

## Recommendations

<p align="justify">

1. Product Strategy:

Focus marketing, production, and inventory efforts on high-performing product lines, particularly Classic Cars.
Reassess strategies for underperforming categories (e.g., Trains and Ships) by evaluating market demand, pricing, and customer preferences.

2. Regional Sales Expansion:

Increase marketing and distribution efforts in underperforming regions like Africa while maintaining a strong presence in North America and Europe.
Leverage data-driven insights to tailor regional strategies based on consumer preferences.

3. Customer Relationship Management:

Enhance loyalty programs and personalized offers for top customers to ensure continued revenue contributions.
Target medium-tier customers with growth potential to diversify revenue sources.

4. Seasonal Sales Planning:

Align promotions, inventory stocking, and campaigns with peak sales months, such as November.
Anticipate and mitigate potential challenges in off-peak months using predictive analytics.

5. Order Management Optimization:

Streamline operations to maximize the number of "Shipped" orders, minimizing cancellations and delays.
Investigate reasons for "Cancelled" and "On Hold" statuses and implement measures to reduce their occurrence.

6. Forecasting and Planning:

Use the SARIMA forecast to plan inventory and resource allocation for the next 12 months, accounting for seasonal variations.
Monitor actual sales against forecasted data to refine predictive models for improved accuracy.

7. Dashboard Utilization:

Leverage interactive dashboards to enable real-time monitoring of sales performance, product trends, and regional insights.
Use visualizations like bar charts, treemaps, and combo charts to communicate findings and align team efforts effectively.

*By implementing these recommendations, the business can sustain growth, enhance performance in weak areas, and maximize profitability.* ðŸ’°ðŸ¥°
